Girl...
Uôôh...

High school she was that girl that make me do the hula hoop around the gym
High school she was
That girl that make me do the hula hoop around the gym
I Never thought that she would come and work for the president
Mr. George Washington
She thought he'd call
She had a good day, bad day, sunny day, rainy day
All he wanna know is is
Closed legs don't get fed, go out there and make my bread
All he wanna know is
She ended up in a road car, bruised up, scarred hard
All he wanna know is
She thought he'd call

See I'mma tell you like Wu told me
Cash rules everything around me
Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all
Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all

Pimpin' got harder cos, hoes got smarter
On the strip is something they don't wanna be a part of
Rather be up in the club shakin' for a thug
For triple times the money and spending it like they wanna
They got they mind on they money, money on they mind
They got they finger on the trigger, hand on the nines
See everyday they feel the struggle, but staying on they grind
And ain't nobody takin' from us, and that's the bottom line

But I know there's a drop in the block
You move slow
You getting' pressure from cops
You don't know not to lay low
Because 25 to life is no joke
To all my real gorillas thuggin'
On top of corners every day strugglin'
All the beautiful women getting' money
Washin' them dollar bills like laundry

See I'mma tell you like Wu told me
Cash rules everything around me
Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all
Singin' dollar dollar bill y'all
